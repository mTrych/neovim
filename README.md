If you try to set up this right from the start after downloading this config you have to clone plugin manager [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) under "Quickstart".
When packer is set up, then navigate to lua/asmathiel/packer.lua and hit ESC and write :PackerSynch to download all plugins
